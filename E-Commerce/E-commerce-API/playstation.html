                Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’
                untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a
                new missile for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten
                Rings and he was severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to
                learn that shrapnel near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and
                fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it
                temporarily.</p>

                and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape. The
                suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it
                up to fight their terrorist captors.

                Batman™: Arkham Knight brings the award-winning Arkham trilogy from Rocksteady Studios to its epic
                conclusion.

                Developed exclusively for New-Gen platforms, Batman: Arkham Knight introduces Rocksteady's uniquely
                designed version of the Batmobile. The highly anticipated addition of this legendary vehicle, combined
                with the acclaimed gameplay of the Arkham series, offers gamers the ultimate and complete Batman
                experience as they tear through the streets and soar across the skyline of the entirety of Gotham City.

                In this explosive finale, Batman faces the ultimate threat against the city that he is sworn to protect,
                as Scarecrow returns to unite the super criminals of Gotham and destroy the Batman forever.</p>
              <p class="paraBatman container w-75 pt-5 mt-5">
                With his back against the wall, Batman turns to his closest allies to help him save Gotham City from the
                clutches of Scarecrow and the Arkham Knight's army. A familiar face also returns to give The Dark Knight
                a message he cannot ignore.
